### Task 1 Review — Set up project structure and core interfaces

**Verdict: Implemented (meets intent) with minor notes**

#### What’s complete
- **Project structure**: `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs`, `src/core/*`, `src/platform/*`, `src/cli/*` are present and organized per the design. Clear separation between library (`disk_speed_test`) and CLI.
- **Core interfaces**:
  - `BenchmarkConfig` with defaults matching the design (4MB seq, 4KB rand, 10s duration, 1GB file, cache disabled).
  - `TestResult`, `BenchmarkResults`, and `ProgressCallback` implemented as specified. `TestResult` includes an extra `sample_count` (useful, non-breaking).
  - `run_benchmark(config, Option<Box<dyn ProgressCallback>>)` exists with validation and a placeholder body — appropriate for Task 1.
- **Platform abstraction layer**: `PlatformOps` matches design (device listing, app data dir, direct I/O create/open, sync). `StorageDevice` and `DeviceType` provided. Platform stubs exist for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS behind `cfg` gates.
- **Cargo configuration**: `Cargo.toml` defines `cdylib` and `rlib` crate types (good for future FFI), binary target, shared deps, and platform-specific deps sections. This supports cross-platform compilation.
- **CLI scaffolding**: `cli/mod.rs`, `args.rs`, `display.rs`, `device_list.rs` present. `main.rs` wires CLI entry and error handling. CLI subcommands are sketched (`list-devices`, `benchmark`).
- **Docs**: `README.md` includes build and cross-compilation target examples and basic usage, aligning with the requirements.

#### Minor notes/caveats
- **Cross-compilation setup**: While `Cargo.toml` and `README` demonstrate target builds, there is no `.cargo/config.toml` to predefine targets or linker settings. This is optional but can simplify cross-builds. Current state is acceptable for Task 1.
- **CLI parsing**: `clap` is declared but not used yet; `args.rs` has a temporary parser. This is expected to be completed under Task 15, so it does not block Task 1.
- **Platform functions**: All platform methods are stubbed (as expected for later tasks). The trait and module layout are sufficient for this task.

#### Alignment to requirements mapping (Task 1)
- **Req 1.1 / 1.3**: Structure and `Cargo.toml` enable cross-platform builds; README shows target builds. Acceptable for this phase.
- **Req 1.2**: CLI exists and is the primary consumer; detailed parsing and full commands are slated for later tasks.
- **Req 2.1 / 2.2**: Core logic is isolated in the library and independent from CLI; `lib.rs` re-exports public API cleanly.

#### Recommendations (non-blocking for Task 1)
- Consider adding `.cargo/config.toml` with common targets and linker hints to streamline cross-compilation.
- Replace the temporary CLI parser with `clap` in Task 15 and wire up all options from the design.
- Keep `TestResult.sample_count` documented in the design/docs to reflect the implementation detail.

Overall, Task 1 is satisfactorily completed. The scaffolding and core interfaces match the design and set up the project for subsequent task implementations.
