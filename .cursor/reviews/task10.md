### Task 10 Review — Implement sequential read test

**Verdict: Implemented (meets intent)**

#### What’s complete
- Opens test file with platform direct I/O; reads using configurable sequential block size (default 4MB).
- Measures throughput with `RealTimeStatsTracker`, reporting progress and completion via `ProgressCallback`.
- Rewinds to start on EOF to sustain reads across the configured duration.
- Unit tests cover functionality, callbacks, nonexistent/empty files, block size variance, duration, rewind behavior, and statistics sanity.

#### Runtime checks
- cargo test sequential_read -- --nocapture: PASS (10/10 tests).

#### Requirements alignment
- Req 4.1/4.4 (default 4MB; overridable), Req 4.3 (read throughput), Req 7.1/7.2 (direct I/O path), Req 8.x (MB/s stats), Req 10.2/10.6 (progress and completion reporting).

#### Notes
- Direct I/O buffer alignment constraints may apply on Linux/Windows; reads generally tolerate unaligned buffers better than writes, but alignment-aware buffers are recommended for robustness.

Overall, sequential read test is complete and validated by tests.
