### Task 11 Review — Implement random write test

**Verdict: Implemented (meets intent) with alignment caveat**

#### What’s complete
- Opens an existing test file with platform direct I/O and performs random seeks and writes using configurable block size (default 4KB).
- Uses `RealTimeStatsTracker` to capture MB/s and reports progress and completion via callbacks.
- Handles end-of-file boundaries properly; accumulates bytes written; includes thorough unit tests (basic, callbacks, readonly, small/large block sizes, duration, empty file, seek verification, large block count).

#### Runtime checks
- cargo test random_write -- --nocapture: PASS (12/12 tests).

#### Requirements alignment
- Req 5.1/5.4 (default 4KB; overridable), Req 5.3 (random write throughput in MB/s), Req 7.1/7.2 (direct I/O path), Req 8.x (MB/s stats), Req 10.3/10.6 (progress and completion reporting).

#### Notes
- On Linux/Windows, `O_DIRECT`/`FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING` require sector-aligned buffers and sizes; current buffer is a `Vec<u8>` which may not be aligned. Tests pass on current environment, but platform-aligned allocation or buffered fallback is recommended for broad robustness.

Overall, random write test is implemented and validated by tests; address buffer alignment for strict direct I/O environments.
