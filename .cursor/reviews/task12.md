### Task 12 Review — Implement random read test

**Verdict: Implemented (meets intent)**

#### What’s complete
- Opens existing test file with platform direct I/O; performs random seeks and reads using configurable block size (default 4KB).
- Uses `RealTimeStatsTracker` to measure MB/s; reports progress and completion via callbacks.
- Handles EOF boundaries and read errors gracefully; includes comprehensive unit tests (basic, callbacks, nonexistent, empty file, small/large blocks, duration, seek verification, large block count).

#### Runtime checks
- cargo test random_read -- --nocapture: PASS (11/11 tests).

#### Requirements alignment
- Req 5.1/5.4 (default 4KB; overridable), Req 5.2 (random read throughput in MB/s), Req 7.1/7.2 (direct I/O path), Req 8.x (MB/s stats), Req 10.4/10.6 (progress and completion reporting).

#### Notes
- Alignment constraints impacting direct I/O reads are generally less strict than writes but can still matter; consider alignment-aware buffers for full portability.

Overall, random read test is implemented and validated by tests.
