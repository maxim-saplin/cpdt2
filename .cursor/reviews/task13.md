### Task 13 Review — Implement memory copy test

**Verdict: Implemented (meets intent)**

#### What’s complete
- Allocates source/destination buffers sized to `file_size_mb`; copies in chunks using `sequential_block_size`.
- Uses `copy_from_slice` to leverage optimized memcpy; measures MB/s with `RealTimeStatsTracker` and reports progress/completion via callbacks.
- Loops until duration elapsed to collect multiple samples; comprehensive unit tests validate functionality, callbacks, block size variation, duration/size edge cases, and basic performance reasonableness.

#### Runtime checks
- cargo test memory_copy -- --nocapture: PASS (10/10 tests).

#### Requirements alignment
- Req 6.1–6.3 (in-memory copy, similar block sizes, same reporting format), Req 8.x (MB/s stats), Req 10.5/10.6 (progress and completion reporting).

#### Notes
- Memory allocation scales with `file_size_mb`; on constrained systems, consider capping or chunking when integrating into the full benchmark orchestration.

Overall, memory copy test is implemented and validated by tests.
