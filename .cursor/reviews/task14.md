### Task 14 Review — Core benchmark orchestration

**Verdict: Implemented (meets intent)**

#### What’s complete
- `run_benchmark` in `src/core/mod.rs` executes tests in order: Sequential Write → Sequential Read → Random Write → Random Read → Memory Copy.
- Generates a unique test file path in the target directory; cleans it up after the run.
- Converts optional boxed `ProgressCallback` to a reference and passes it through to each test.
- Non-fatal error handling: if a dependent test fails (e.g., sequential read), it logs and continues, setting defaults for that result; memory test always attempted.
- Filesystem sync attempted at the end when cache disabled.

#### Runtime checks
- cargo test --lib: PASS (94 tests total).
- cargo run -- benchmark /tmp --duration 1 --file-size 10MB --output-format json: PASS — runs all tests, prints JSON results; file is cleaned up.

#### Requirements alignment
- Req 2.1/2.2 (library orchestrates complete run), Req 7.4 (cleanup and sync), Req 8.4 (sufficient sampling via test implementations), Req 11.4/11.5 (non-fatal logging, results available despite partial failures).

#### Notes
- Space preflight is minimal (relies on errors from create); consider querying available space and returning `InsufficientSpace` before starting.
- Direct I/O alignment constraints noted in earlier tasks still apply to test bodies.

Overall, orchestration is correct, resilient, and validated via runtime checks.
