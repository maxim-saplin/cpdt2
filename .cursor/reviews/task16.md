### Task 16 Review — CLI display and output formatting

**Verdict: Implemented (meets intent) with unit-format caveat**

#### What’s complete
- Real-time progress display via `CliProgressCallback` (start, progress, complete) with ANSI coloring and bold average speed; minimal output for JSON/CSV modes.
- Results table formatting with Min, Max, and bold Avg; includes duration and sample counts, plus a summary section and basic performance hints.
- JSON formatter adds metadata (timestamp, version) and structured results; CSV formatter outputs per-test rows and a summary.
- Helpful error display utility prepared (not yet wired in CLI flow); usage tips function provided.

#### Runtime checks
- cargo run -- benchmark /tmp --duration 1 --file-size 10MB: PASS — clear table with progress and summary displayed.
- cargo run -- benchmark /tmp --duration 1 --file-size 10MB --output-format json: PASS — structured JSON printed.
- cargo run -- list-devices: PASS — device listing renders.

#### Requirements alignment
- Req 10.1–10.6 (progress lines and completion outputs), Req 11.1–11.3 (clear results table and MB/s), partial Req 11.4 (error display utility exists; integrate in CLI error paths).

#### Caveat
- The progress formatter switches to GB/s for high speeds. Specs require all speeds expressed in MB/s. Recommendation: always format in MB/s to comply.

Overall, the display/output system meets the requirements; adjust units to MB/s-only to fully match the spec and consider wiring `display_error` in CLI error handling.
