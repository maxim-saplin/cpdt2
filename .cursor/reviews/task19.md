# Task 19 Review — Implement integration tests for benchmark operations

Status: Completed

Evidence:
- Integration tests across `tests/`:
  - `benchmark_operations_integration_tests.rs`: verifies each test type (seq read/write, random read/write, memory copy), progress callbacks, cleanup, timing limits, edge cases (empty files, large/small blocks).
  - `benchmark_complete_execution_tests.rs` and `benchmark_integration_tests.rs`: orchestrated end-to-end runs, event ordering, error recovery, cleanup verification, timing assertions, concurrent runs.
  - `benchmark_cross_platform_regression_tests.rs`: platform-agnostic performance consistency and baseline checks with conservative thresholds.

Runtime checks:
- Requires `--features test-utils` for infra helpers: 88 total tests reported across integration groups; all passed.
  - Command: `cargo test --test '*' --features test-utils` → all groups green.

Gaps/Risks:
- Integration runs are time-consuming (minutes). Acceptable for CI nightly or matrix.

Recommendation:
- Keep `test-utils` feature documented in CONTRIBUTING; existing docs cover it.
