### Task 2 Review — Implement core data structures and configuration

**Verdict: Implemented (meets intent)**

#### What’s complete
- **BenchmarkConfig** (`src/core/config.rs`):
  - Fields match design/requirements: `target_path`, `sequential_block_size` (default 4MB), `random_block_size` (default 4KB), `test_duration_seconds` (default 10s), `disable_os_cache` (default true), `file_size_mb` (default 1GB).
  - `Default` implemented with correct values; `new(target_path)` convenience ctor.
  - `validate()` enforces non-zero sizes/duration/file size and that `target_path` exists.
  - `file_size_bytes()` helper provided.
- **TestResult** (`src/core/stats.rs`):
  - Contains `min_speed_mbps`, `max_speed_mbps`, `avg_speed_mbps`, `test_duration`, plus `sample_count` (extra; useful, non-breaking).
  - `Default`, `new(...)` constructors and serde derives present.
- **BenchmarkResults** (`src/core/mod.rs`):
  - Aggregates five test results: sequential write/read, random write/read, memory copy.
  - serde derives present.
- **BenchmarkError** (`src/core/mod.rs`):
  - Covers platform error wrapping, IO, configuration errors, insufficient space with named fields, permission denied, and test interruption. Matches design intent closely.
- **Statistics scaffolding** (`src/core/stats.rs`):
  - `StatisticsCollector` provides sampling, min/max/avg computation, MB/s calculation. While slated for Task 4, it supports Task 2 data model completeness.
- **Public API surface** (`src/lib.rs`):
  - Re-exports of core types (`BenchmarkConfig`, `BenchmarkResults`, `TestResult`, `ProgressCallback`, `run_benchmark`, `BenchmarkError`). Clear separation of library API from CLI.
- **Unit tests**:
  - Config defaults/validation tests and statistics tests exist and pass basic expectations.

#### Minor notes
- **Design parity tweaks**:
  - `TestResult.sample_count` is an addition vs design doc; worthwhile to document for consumers.
  - `BenchmarkError::InsufficientSpace` uses named fields (`required`, `available`) vs tuple in design. Semantics align; consider reflecting this in the design/docs.
- **Validation depth**:
  - `validate()` currently checks existence of `target_path` but not writability or available space; those can be deferred to later tasks (platform ops and orchestration) but are worth noting.

#### Alignment to requirements (Task 2 references)
- **Req 4.4 and 5.4**: Block sizes are configurable and defaults are correct.
- **Req 9.1–9.4**: Configuration supports overriding block sizes, duration, file size, target path, and caching behavior.
- API is independent of CLI (Req 2.1, 2.2), with clean re-exports for external use (also aligns with Req 2.3 spirit).

#### Recommendations (non-blocking)
- Document units explicitly in `BenchmarkConfig` doc comments (bytes vs MB) to avoid ambiguity.
- Consider enhancing `validate()` later to check directory writability and to preflight approximate required space vs available (to back `InsufficientSpace`).
- When Task 4 lands, ensure `StatisticsCollector` sampling cadence and units are referenced in docs to satisfy reporting requirements.

Overall, Task 2 is complete and sets a solid foundation for subsequent tasks.
