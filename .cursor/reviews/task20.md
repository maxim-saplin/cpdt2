# Task 20 Review â€” Implement CLI integration tests

Status: Completed

Evidence:
- `tests/cli_integration_tests.rs` validates:
  - `--help`, `benchmark --help`, `--version` behavior.
  - `list-devices` succeeds and outputs expected text.
  - `benchmark` basic happy path with small sizes; confirms all test labels and MB/s present.
  - JSON and CSV outputs parse/shape correctness.
  - Argument parsing combos, short flags, invalid inputs, exit codes.
  - Configuration display echoes parameters.
  - Progress and completion signals present.

Runtime checks:
- CLI integration tests passed in the integration run (`--features test-utils`).

Gaps/Risks:
- Binary path resolution uses `current_exe()` parent heuristic, which is standard for Rust integration tests; works locally.

Recommendation:
- None. Coverage is strong across formats and errors.
