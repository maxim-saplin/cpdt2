# Task 21 Review â€” Add platform-specific test coverage

Status: Completed

Evidence:
- Platform-specific tests under `src/platform/`:
  - `windows_test.rs`, `macos_test.rs`, `linux_test.rs`: guarded by target OS, cover device enumeration, direct I/O creation/open, app data dir resolution, filesystem sync, large file ops, formatting, error handling, concurrency.
  - `error_conditions_test.rs`: comprehensive negative-paths using `MockPlatform` across enumeration, file ops, sync, permission errors, unicode, network/removable scenarios.
  - `mobile_platforms_test.rs`: Android/iOS stubs behind cfg with rich mock-based tests validating mobile-specific constraints.
  - `platform_test.rs` and `mock_platform.rs`: unit tests for types and mocks, concurrency, serialization, trait bounds.

Runtime checks:
- Cross-platform tests compile where applicable; mock-based tests pass on non-target hosts.

Gaps/Risks:
- Real Windows/macOS/Linux direct I/O tests execute only on respective runners; CI matrix in `ci.yml` covers those OSes.

Recommendation:
- None. Coverage breadth is excellent with mocks ensuring host-agnostic validation.
