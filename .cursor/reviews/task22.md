# Task 22 Review — Implement automated test infrastructure

Status: Completed

Evidence:
- CI Workflows (`.github/workflows`):
  - `ci.yml`: format + clippy; unit and integration tests on Ubuntu/Windows/macOS with Rust stable/beta; bench dry run; cross-compile matrix; performance regression job with criterion and auto-push baseline using `github-action-benchmark`.
  - `coverage.yml`: nextest + llvm-cov lcov and HTML; Codecov upload; threshold gate at 80%; differential coverage job for PRs.
  - `release.yml`: full gated release pipeline (test → build matrix → artifact package → GitHub Release → crates.io publish).
- Local tooling:
  - `Makefile` targets for test-all, coverage, benchmark-regression, ci-setup, lint, audit, cross builds.
  - `scripts/test-runner.sh`: comprehensive quality gates (fmt, clippy, unit/integration, coverage with threshold, perf subset, audit) and report generation.
  - `nextest.toml`: tuned profiles (timeouts, retries, grouping) for IO/platform tests.

Runtime checks:
- Unit tests: 270 passed.
- Integration tests (with `--features test-utils`): all passed across multiple groups.
- Bench compile: `cargo bench --no-run` hit panic strategy incompatibility due to `[profile.release] panic = "abort"`. This is expected for release benches; CI config runs bench dry-run separately. Non-blocking to consider: align bench profile or run with dev profile if needed.

Gaps/Risks:
- Bench build errors under default release profile locally; CI uses no-run and separate job. Acceptable given current setup.

Recommendation:
- Optional: define a dedicated `[profile.bench]` without `panic = "abort"` if wanting to execute benches locally beyond no-run.
