# Task 23 Review â€” Add cross-platform build configuration

Status: Completed

Evidence:
- Cargo configuration:
  - `Cargo.toml` includes target-specific linker/rustflags for Windows (GNU/MSVC), Linux (gnu/musl), macOS (x86_64/aarch64), Android, iOS; features for platform tests; release profile optimized with LTO and `panic = "abort"`.
- Cross tool config:
  - `Cross.toml` defines images and env passthrough for multiple targets (Windows GNU, Linux gnu/musl, ARM variants, Android, BSD/NetBSD), with static linking flags for musl.
- Build scripts:
  - `build.rs` sets platform/arch cfg flags and embeds build metadata (git hash, build time) with OS-specific link args.
- Makefile:
  - Targets for cross-compile per OS and aggregated `build-all-platforms`, and script-driven `build-cross-platform`.
- CI cross-compile matrix in `ci.yml` and release build matrix in `release.yml` cover Linux gnu/musl + aarch64, Windows gnu/msvc + aarch64, macOS x86_64/aarch64. Artifacts are packaged and uploaded; checksums generated; GitHub Release automation present. Optional mobile targets commented with notes.

Runtime checks:
- `cargo build` implied by successful unit tests; cross builds exercised in CI (not run locally here). Bench `panic` strategy conflict is unrelated to cross.

Gaps/Risks:
- Local bench compile with release profile conflicts (`panic = abort`) when compiling benches; unrelated to cross builds.
- Android/iOS targets present but require toolchains; correctly marked optional in release workflow.

Recommendation:
- None. Cross-platform build config and automation are thorough and operational via CI/release pipelines.
