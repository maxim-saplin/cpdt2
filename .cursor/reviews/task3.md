### Task 3 Review — Platform abstraction layer foundation

**Verdict: Implemented (meets intent)**

#### What’s complete
- **Trait and types** (`src/platform/mod.rs`):
  - `PlatformOps` trait defines required methods: `list_storage_devices`, `get_app_data_dir`, `create_direct_io_file`, `open_direct_io_file`, `sync_file_system` — matches design.
  - `StorageDevice` includes `name`, `mount_point`, `total_space`, `available_space`, `device_type` with clear units (bytes) and serde derives.
  - `DeviceType` enum covers common device categories.
  - `PlatformError` includes IO, unsupported platform, device enumeration failure, direct I/O not supported, insufficient permissions.
- **Conditional compilation and dispatch**:
  - Platform modules exist for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS with `#[cfg(...)]` gates.
  - Convenience functions (`list_storage_devices`, `get_app_data_dir`, `create_direct_io_file`, `open_direct_io_file`, `sync_file_system`) dispatch to the active platform via `cfg` and produce a compile-time error for unknown targets. This satisfies platform detection/setup.
- **Stub implementations**:
  - Each platform module implements `PlatformOps` with placeholders. Where applicable, simple partial implementations exist (e.g., macOS/Linux `get_app_data_dir` constructing expected paths; others return `UnsupportedPlatform` or `DirectIoNotSupported`). This is appropriate for a foundation task.
- **Cargo configuration** (`Cargo.toml`):
  - Target-specific dependency sections are declared for each platform (Windows/macOS/Linux/Android/iOS), supporting future concrete implementations.

#### Notes/caveats
- Current stubs return empty device lists and `DirectIoNotSupported` for direct I/O operations. This is expected to be implemented in Tasks 6–8 and does not block Task 3.
- Android/iOS `get_app_data_dir` currently return `UnsupportedPlatform`. Acceptable for now; will need completion in mobile tasks.
- The `compile_error!` branches in convenience functions ensure unknown platforms fail fast at compile time, which is reasonable.

#### Alignment to requirements (Task 3 references)
- Supports future compliance with Req 3.1–3.4 by providing the necessary interfaces and module structure:
  - Device listing API and `StorageDevice` shape (3.1, 3.2).
  - App data directory hook (3.3).
  - Direct I/O hooks for cache-bypass semantics (3.4 and Req 7.x later).

#### Recommendations (non-blocking)
- Consider adding brief module-level docs per platform outlining intended APIs/flags (e.g., Windows `FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING`), to guide later implementations.
- Where feasible, add minimal smoke tests behind platform `cfg(test)` to ensure the convenience dispatch functions compile and link per target.

Overall, the abstraction layer and platform scaffolding are in place and suitable for building out platform-specific functionality in subsequent tasks.
