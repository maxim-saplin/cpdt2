### Task 5 Review — Progress reporting system

**Verdict: Implemented (meets intent) with one requirement mismatch**

#### What’s complete
- **Core trait**: `ProgressCallback` defined in `src/core/mod.rs` with `on_test_start`, `on_progress`, `on_test_complete`. Docstrings specify approx. 100ms cadence and thread-safety requirements.
- **Reporting engine**: `src/core/progress.rs` includes:
  - `ProgressReporter` with thread-safe callback dispatch, 100ms default throttling, custom interval, force update, and clone support.
  - Utilities: `NoOpProgressCallback`, `TestProgressCallback`, and `ProgressEvent` for testing/inspection.
  - Unit tests for throttling, concurrency, clone behavior, and event capture.
- **CLI display**: `src/cli/display.rs` implements `CliProgressCallback` with:
  - Real-time display of test name and speed on progress, and Min/Max/Avg (Avg bold) on completion.
  - ANSI color/bold support gated by `atty`. Verbose mode and speed formatting helper.
  - Integration of atty via `Cargo.toml`.
- **Integration tests**: `src/core/progress_integration_test.rs` simulates multi-test execution, throttling behavior, and edge cases.
- **Plan status**: Task 5 marked complete in `.kiro/specs/disk-speed-test/tasks.md`.

#### Requirements alignment (10.1–10.6)
- 10.1–10.5: During each test, the current test name and real-time speed are displayed; start notifications are printed. ✓
- 10.6: On completion, output shows Min, Max, and average with bold emphasis for Avg. ✓ (bold via ANSI when TTY).

#### Issue found (needs follow-up)
- **Units deviation from Requirements 8.5/11.2**: `CliProgressCallback::format_speed` switches to GB/s for speeds ≥ 1000 MB/s. The requirements mandate that “all speeds SHALL be expressed in MB/s.” This should remain MB/s everywhere to comply.

#### Minor notes (non-blocking for Task 5)
- Bold emphasis is disabled when stdout is not a TTY (colors off). Consider a fallback emphasis (e.g., surrounding Avg with asterisks) to preserve emphasis in redirected output.
- Ensure future wiring uses `ProgressReporter` in test execution paths (Tasks 9–14) so the 100ms cadence is honored consistently.

Overall, the progress reporting system is robust and well-tested. Addressing the MB/s-only unit requirement will fully align with the specifications.
