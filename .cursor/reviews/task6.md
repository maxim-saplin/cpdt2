### Task 6 Review — Windows platform-specific operations

**Verdict: Implemented (meets intent)**

#### What’s complete
- **Device enumeration**: Uses `GetLogicalDrives()` to enumerate letters and `GetDriveTypeW()` to classify. Retrieves capacity and free space via `GetDiskFreeSpaceExW`. Produces `StorageDevice` with `name`, `mount_point`, `total_space`, `available_space`, `device_type`.
- **Direct I/O support**:
  - `create_direct_io_file()` opens with `FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING | FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH | FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN` and sets size via `SetFilePointerEx` + `SetEndOfFile`.
  - `open_direct_io_file()` opens with the same flags and configurable access (read/write).
- **App data directory**: Resolves `%LOCALAPPDATA%\disk-speed-test`.
- **Filesystem sync**: `sync_file_system()` opens the file and calls `FlushFileBuffers`.
- **Error handling**: Uses `last_os_error` where applicable; maps failures to `PlatformError` variants.
- **Tests**: Windows-only tests cover device enumeration, app data dir, direct I/O create/open, and sync. Also verifies drive-type mapping. Cargo features updated to include `winnt`, `minwindef`, `winerror`.

#### Requirements alignment
- Matches: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4.

#### Notes/caveats
- **NO_BUFFERING constraints**: On Windows, `FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING` requires sector-size alignment for buffer addresses, sizes, and file offsets. The platform layer is correct, but higher-level read/write code must ensure 4KB (or device sector) alignment. Consider exposing a helper to query the logical sector size.
- **Syncing directories**: `sync_file_system()` flushes a file handle. If a directory path is passed, this will fail; callers should pass a file path or the implementation could be extended to handle directory handles/volume flushes if needed.
- **Drive filtering**: CD/DVD and network drives are included; that aligns with the spec but may warrant filtering in the CLI, depending on UX goals.

#### Recommendations (non-blocking)
- Provide a platform helper to obtain sector size (e.g., `GetDiskFreeSpaceW` or `IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY`) for alignment guidance.
- Optionally, set `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED` to support async I/O in future.

Overall, the Windows implementation satisfies Task 6, with sensible APIs and tests.
