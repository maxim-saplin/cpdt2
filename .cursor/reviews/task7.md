### Task 7 Review — macOS platform-specific operations

**Verdict: Implemented (meets intent)**

#### What’s complete
- **Device enumeration**: Scans `/Volumes` and adds root `/`. Uses `statvfs` to compute `total_space` and `available_space`. Builds `StorageDevice` with human-readable names.
- **Direct I/O semantics**:
  - `create_direct_io_file()` creates/truncates file, sets length, and applies `F_NOCACHE` to the FD to bypass OS cache.
  - `open_direct_io_file()` opens for read or write and applies `F_NOCACHE`.
- **Filesystem sync**: `sync_file_system()` uses `fcntl(F_FULLFSYNC)` to ensure data is committed to stable storage (stronger than `fsync`).
- **App data directory**: `~/Library/Application Support/disk-speed-test` is created if missing.
- **Error handling**: Propagates IO errors with context where relevant.
- **Tests**: Cover app data dir creation, device listing (includes `/`), direct I/O open/create, sync (file and directory), device-type heuristics, and construction from path.

#### Requirements alignment
- Matches: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4.

#### Notes/caveats
- **Directory sync semantics**: `F_FULLFSYNC` is typically used for file descriptors; its behavior on directory FDs can vary. Tests attempt both; if portability issues arise, consider falling back to `fsync` on directories.
- **Device type heuristics**: `determine_device_type()` uses name/path heuristics (e.g., "USB", "External"); sufficient for now, but may misclassify in edge cases.
- **F_NOCACHE scope**: Applies per-FD; ensure all IO uses the same FD to maintain cache bypass semantics.

#### Recommendations (non-blocking)
- Consider using Disk Arbitration framework or `getmntinfo()` for richer device metadata when moving beyond `/Volumes` heuristics.
- Optionally log when `F_FULLFSYNC` fails and fall back to `fsync` for better resilience.

Overall, the macOS implementation fulfills Task 7 with appropriate cache-bypass and sync behaviors and good test coverage.
