# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a cross-platform disk speed test utility that can be compiled as a command-line tool for macOS, Windows, and Linux. The utility will provide comprehensive disk performance measurements including sequential and random read/write operations, with configurable block sizes and proper handling of OS-level caching. The primary audience is computer enthusiasts who want to understand their system's storage performance. The core testing functionality will be implemented as an isolated library component to enable future integration with GUI applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to run disk speed tests from the command line on any major operating system, so that I can benchmark storage performance consistently across different platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the utility is compiled THEN it SHALL run natively on macOS, Windows, and Linux
2. WHEN the utility is executed THEN it SHALL provide a command-line interface for all operations
3. WHEN the utility is built THEN it SHALL produce a single executable file for each target platform

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate disk testing functionality into my applications, so that I can provide storage benchmarking capabilities without reimplementing the core logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN it SHALL include an isolated library component containing all test logic
2. WHEN the library is used THEN it SHALL be independent of the CLI interface
3. WHEN the library is integrated THEN it SHALL provide a clean API for external applications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see available storage devices on my system, so that I can select the appropriate target for testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI is run with a list devices command THEN it SHALL display all available storage devices
2. WHEN listing devices THEN it SHALL show device names, mount points, and available space
3. WHEN targeting system drives THEN it SHALL use OS-appropriate writable application folders
4. WHEN targeting non-system drives THEN it SHALL allow direct path specification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want to run sequential read and write tests, so that I can measure sustained throughput performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sequential tests are executed THEN they SHALL use 4MB block sizes by default
2. WHEN sequential read tests run THEN they SHALL measure and report read throughput
3. WHEN sequential write tests run THEN they SHALL measure and report write throughput
4. WHEN block size is specified THEN it SHALL override the default 4MB size

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a computer enthusiast, I want to run random read and write tests, so that I can measure random access performance in MB/s.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN random tests are executed THEN they SHALL use 4KB block sizes by default
2. WHEN random read tests run THEN they SHALL perform random seek operations and measure throughput in MB/s
3. WHEN random write tests run THEN they SHALL perform random seek operations and measure throughput in MB/s
4. WHEN block size is specified THEN it SHALL override the default 4KB size

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system benchmarker, I want to test memory copy performance, so that I can compare disk performance against memory bandwidth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory copy tests are executed THEN they SHALL perform in-memory buffer copying operations
2. WHEN memory tests run THEN they SHALL use similar block sizes to disk tests for comparison
3. WHEN memory tests complete THEN they SHALL report throughput in the same format as disk tests

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want accurate disk performance measurements, so that I can get reliable benchmarking data without OS interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN disk tests are executed THEN they SHALL disable OS read buffering by default
2. WHEN disk tests are executed THEN they SHALL disable OS write caching by default
3. WHEN buffering options are provided THEN users SHALL be able to override default behavior
4. WHEN tests create files THEN they SHALL use appropriate OS flags to bypass caches

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive performance statistics, so that I can understand the full range of performance characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any test completes THEN it SHALL report low-percentile speed (P5) in MB/s
2. WHEN any test completes THEN it SHALL report maximum speed in MB/s
3. WHEN any test completes THEN it SHALL report average speed in MB/s with bold formatting
4. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL collect sufficient samples to provide meaningful statistics
5. WHEN results are displayed THEN all speeds SHALL be expressed in MB/s (Megabytes per second)

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize test parameters, so that I can adapt the benchmarks to my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN block sizes are specified THEN they SHALL override default values for the respective test types
2. WHEN test duration or file size is specified THEN it SHALL control the extent of testing
3. WHEN target paths are specified THEN they SHALL override default device selection
4. WHEN caching options are specified THEN they SHALL override default cache-bypassing behavior

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a computer enthusiast, I want to see real-time progress during testing, so that I can monitor performance as tests execute.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Sequential Write test is running THEN it SHALL display "Sequential Write" and current speed in MB/s
2. WHEN Sequential Read test is running THEN it SHALL display "Sequential Read" and current speed in MB/s  
3. WHEN Random Write test is running THEN it SHALL display "Random Write" and current speed in MB/s
4. WHEN Random Read test is running THEN it SHALL display "Random Read" and current speed in MB/s
5. WHEN Memory Copy test is running THEN it SHALL display "Memory Copy" and current speed in MB/s
6. WHEN each test completes THEN the display SHALL update to show P5, P95, and average (bold) speeds

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and informative output, so that I can understand test results and any issues that occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any test is running THEN the utility SHALL display the current test name and real-time speed in MB/s
2. WHEN tests complete THEN results SHALL show P5, P95, and average (bold) speeds in MB/s for each test
3. WHEN all tests complete THEN results SHALL be formatted in a clear table showing Sequential Write, Sequential Read, Random Write, Random Read, and Memory Copy results
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be reported with helpful diagnostic information
5. WHEN tests fail THEN the utility SHALL provide guidance on potential causes
