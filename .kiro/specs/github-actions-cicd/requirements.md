# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for a Rust cross-platform application. The system will provide automated building, testing, and release management with quality gates and artifact management to ensure code quality while minimizing storage overhead.

## Requirements

### 1. Automated CI Pipeline with Cross-Platform Builds

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD workflows that run on every push, so that I can ensure code quality and have ready-to-use binaries without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to any branch THEN the system SHALL trigger a CI workflow automatically
2. WHEN the CI workflow runs THEN the system SHALL use a single Linux runner to cross-compile binaries for macOS, Windows, and Linux platforms
3. WHEN cross-compiling THEN the system SHALL leverage the existing Cross.toml configuration and cross-compilation toolchain
4. WHEN the CI workflow completes successfully THEN the system SHALL store compiled artifacts
5. WHEN new artifacts are created THEN the system SHALL automatically remove previous artifacts to prevent storage pollution
6. IF any build step fails THEN the system SHALL fail the entire workflow and report the error
7. WHEN building for each platform THEN the system SHALL produce binaries compatible with their respective operating systems
8. IF any platform build fails THEN the system SHALL report which platform failed and continue with other platforms

### 2. Quality Gates and Testing Pipeline

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and quality gates in the CI pipeline, so that I can catch issues early and maintain code quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CI workflow runs THEN the system SHALL execute all test suites before building artifacts
2. IF any test fails THEN the system SHALL fail the workflow and prevent artifact creation
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate code coverage reports
4. IF code coverage decreases THEN the system SHALL issue a warning but not fail the workflow
5. WHEN quality checks pass THEN the system SHALL proceed to build and artifact creation

### 3. Manual Release Management

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want a manual release workflow that creates versioned releases, so that I can control when releases are published with proper versioning and attached binaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I manually trigger the release workflow THEN the system SHALL first run the complete CI pipeline
2. IF the CI pipeline fails THEN the system SHALL abort the release process
3. WHEN CI passes THEN the system SHALL create a draft release with automatic version increment
4. WHEN creating a release THEN the system SHALL attach all platform binaries to the release
5. WHEN the release is created THEN the system SHALL use semantic versioning based on commit history or manual input
